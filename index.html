      A workplace learning and performance practitioner specializing in various types of interpersonal communication; 
      currently working for a national corporation as a communication instructor in public speaking,
      intercultural relations, and communication skills.</p>  

      <ul id="specialties">
			<li><b>Public speaking</b> is not only a workplace skill.  It can be used in many different contexts.  
      For those who struggle with anxiety, positive self encouragement, repeatedly practicing a standard format - correcting your
      own mistakes, and breathing exercises can help transform fear into confidence.

      <li><b>Intercultural communication</b> is an important part of conducting business in today's global economy.
      In a business environment, if a person unexpectedly meets someone who is from a culture they have little or no knowledge  
      about, it is extremely important to project a friendly demeanor using language that is honest, 
      open-minded and inquisitive.  
      <a href="profile.html#sp2">read more...</a></li>
  
      <li><b>Communication skills</b> are acquired through lots of practice.  This, inevitably, includes making
      a considerable amount of mistakes.  The important thing about making mistakes is to learn from them and consciously
      employ strategies for increasing effective exchanges.<a href="profile.html#sp3">read more...</a></li>
