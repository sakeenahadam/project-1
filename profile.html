<h2>Existing Competencies</h2>
	<p>I am quite confortable in any traditional learning environment; as a student, an instuctor, or a workplace practitioner.  I like to think that in academia is where I belong.  I owe one of my 
	deepest core values to my alma mater, Northeastern Illinois University, because I am truly a life-long learner.  My 
	inqusitive nature has landed me here.  Professionally, I have accumulated over six years of work in higher education
	in roles such as: student worker, administrative assistant and, now, instructor.  I have worked for the University of 
	Wisconsin in Madison, the Illinios Institute of Technology in Chicago, and now, a national career college. </p>
<h2>Career Aspirations</h2>	
	<p>So far, I have acheived a Baccaloreate degree in Liberal Arts, which is really a degree in interpersonal
	communication with an emphasis in intercultural communication and workplace learning and performance (WLP).  I  
	hold a Master's degree in Speech Communication, also with the same emphasis.  I have a professional 
	certificate	from the American Society for Training and Development (ASTD) in WLP and I am currently pursuing a second 
	professional certificate at the Illinios Institute of Technology in Technical Communication.  With all of 
	the education I have gratefully received to date, I would like to further develop my instructional design skills to 
	include workplace e-training.  I have found that I harbor a wonderful fascination with coding; now, if I could 
	only learn all of the tags! At some point in the near future, I may seriously pursue a doctorate degree, because 
	I absolutely love teaching.  As I stated before, I belong in academia. I am interested in pursuing a topic that somehow mixes technical communication with intercultural relations.</p>
<h2>Area of Expertise #1: Public Speaking</h2>
  <p>I currently train adults in the art of public speaking and I absolutely love it.  My natural gift for gab has turned into a a career choice of teaching others how to communicate effectively in most environments.  Especially, when voice projection, inflection, eye contact, hand gestures and language choice are of the utmost concern.  From my experience, I've learned that confidence in oneself is key.  Also, applying existing knowledge to the task of developing a speech and relating it to a target audience is also very important for those who are seeking to increase their presentation skills.  I find that my style of teaching public speaking is to coach students through a process of building confidence, assessing their existing knowledge that is relevant to their speech topics, identifying strong connections with their audiences, and using appropriate language that increases their credibility.</p>
<h2>Area of Expertise #2: Intercultural Communication</h2>
  <p>Intercultural communication is another topic in communication that I specialize in.  I have been fortunate enough to learn it, live it, and pass it on.  The aim of successful intercultural relations is to allow the experience of learning different cultures to transform oneself.  Inevitably, intercultural interaction will affect a person's outlook on life, provided they actively reflect on their experiences.  Gaining an appreciation for positive intercultural relations is a key component to achieving a healthy global perspective.  It fosters confidence in communication through empathy, which creates a human connection that cannot be easily broken.  Of course, most people, naturally, favor their own ethnic group.  However, ethnocentrism (a feeling of ethnic superiority) should never be harnessed or encouraged.    
  </p>
  <h2>Area of Expertise #3: Communication Skills</h2>
  <p>Knowing how to communicate, somehow, is a given.  However, communicating effectively is a skill that needs to be acquired.  The successful sending and receiving of messages depends on many factors and the desired result is efficiency.  Understanding context coupled with receiver knowledge and expectations provide a healthy foundation for a successful communicative exchange.  Skill building involves a conscious effort to: arm oneself with basic knowledge of how to communicate effectively in various environments, practice in the real world, and to develop one's own style.  Also, forgiving oneself for insignificant flaws in everyday speech balanced with a valuable effort to reduce occurrences of miscommunication due to these flaws is extremely important.
