  <p class="me">
  A workplace learning and performance practitioner specializing in various types of interpersonal communication; 
  currently working for a national corporation as a communication instructor in public speaking, intercultural
  relations, and communication skills.</p>  

  <h2 id="spec">Existing Competencies</h2>
	<p class="pp">I am quite confortable in any traditional learning environment; as a student, an instructor, or a workplace 
  practitioner.  I like to think that in academia is where I belong.  I owe one of my deepest core values to my alma mater,
  Northeastern Illinois University, because I am truly a life long learner.  Professionally, I have accumulated over six years
  of work in higher education in roles such as: student worker, administrative assistant and, now, instructor.  I have worked
  for the University of Wisconsin in Madison, the Illinios Institute of Technology in Chicago, and now, a national career
  college. </p>

 <h2 id="sp1">Specialty #1: Public Speaking</h2>
 <p class="pp">I currently train adults in the art of public speaking and I absolutely love it.  My natural gift for gab has
  turned into a career of teaching others how to communicate effectively in most environments.  Especially, when voice
  projection, inflection, eye contact, hand gestures and language choice are of the utmost concern.  From my experience,
  I've learned that confidence in oneself is key.  Also, applying existing knowledge to the task of developing a speech and
  relating it to a target audience is also very important for those who are seeking to increase their presentation skills.  I
  find that my style of teaching public speaking is to coach students through a process of building confidence, assessing their
  existing knowledge that is relevant to their speech topics, identifying strong connections with their audiences, and using
  appropriate language that increases their credibility.</p>

 <h2 id="sp2">Specialty #2: Intercultural Communication</h2>
 <p class="pp">Intercultural communication is another topic in communication that I specialize in.  I have been fortunate enough
  to learn it, live it, and pass it on.  The aim of successful intercultural relations is to allow the experience of learning
  different cultures to transform oneself.  Inevitably, intercultural interaction will affect a person's outlook on life,
  provided they actively reflect on their experiences.  Gaining an appreciation for positive intercultural relations is a key
  component to achieving a healthy global perspective.  It fosters confidence in communication through empathy, which creates a
  human connection that cannot be easily broken.  Of course, most people, naturally, favor their own ethnic group.  However,
  ethnocentrism (a feeling of ethnic superiority) should never be harnessed or encouraged.</p>

 <h2 id="sp3">Specialty #3: Communication Skills</h2>
 <p class="pp">Knowing how to communicate, naturally, is a given.  However, I advocate that communicating effectively is a skill
  that needs to be acquired.  The successful sending and receiving of messages depends on many factors and the desired result is
  efficiency.  I emphasize to my students that context coupled with receiver knowledge and expectations provide a healthy
  foundation for a successful communicative exchange.  Skill building involves a conscious effort to: arm oneself with basic
  knowledge of how to communicate effectively in various environments, practice in the real world, and to develop one's own
  style.  Also, I believe that forgiving oneself for insignificant flaws in everyday speech, balanced with a valuable  
  effort to reduce occurrences of miscommunication due to these flaws, is extremely important.</p>

 <h2 id="spca">Career Aspirations</h2>	
 <p class="pp">So far, I have acheived a Baccaloreate degree in Liberal Arts, which is really a degree in interpersonal
	communication with an emphasis in intercultural communication and workplace learning and performance (WLP).  I  
	hold a Master's degree in Speech Communication, also with the same emphasis.  I have a professional 
	certificate	from the American Society for Training and Development (ASTD) in WLP and I am currently pursuing a second 
	professional certificate at the Illinios Institute of Technology in Technical Communication.  With all of 
	the education I have gratefully received to date, I would like to further develop my instructional design skills to 
	include workplace e-training.  At some point in the near future, I may seriously pursue a doctorate degree, because 
	I absolutely love sharing what I've learned with others.  As I stated before, I belong in academia.</p>
