<h2>Existing Competencies</h2>
	<p>I am quite confortable in any traditional learning environment; as a student, in administration, an instuctor, 
	or a workplace trainer/facilitator.  I like to think that in academia is where I belong.  I owe one of my 
	deepest core values to my alma mater, Northeastern Illinois University. I am truly a life-long learner.  My 
	inqusitive nature has landed me here.  Professionally, I have accumulated over six years of work in higher education
	in roles such as: student worker, administrative assistant and, now, instructor.  I have worked for the University of 
	Wisconsin in Madison, the Illinios Institute of Technology in Chicago, and now, a national career college. </p>
<h2>Career Aspirations</h2>	
	<p>So far, I have acheived a Baccaloreate degree in Liberal Arts, which is really a degree in interpersonal
	communication with an emphasis in intercultural communication and workplace learning and performance (WLP).  I  
	hold a Masters degree in Speech Communication, also with the same emphasis.  I have a professional 
	certificate	from the American Society for Training and Development (ASTD) in WLP and I am currently pursuing a second 
	professional certificate through the Illinios Institute of Technology in Technical Communication.  With all of 
	the education I have gratefully received to date, I would like to further develop my instructional design skills to 
	include workplace e-training.  I have found that I harbor a wonderful fascination with coding.  Now, if I could 
	just learn all of the tags! At some point in the near future, I may seriously pursue a doctorate degree, because 
	I absolutely love teaching.  As I stated before, I belong in academia.  Now, if I could just find a topic that I 
	am interested in enough to warrant such an intense study. Below is a sample of my work.</p>
